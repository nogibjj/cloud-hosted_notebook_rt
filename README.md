### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
Extensive exploratory data analysis was performed to grasp the underlying patterns and characteristics of the dataset. The notebook delves deep into the descriptive statistics of pivotal attributes, showcasing the mean, median, and mode of specific variables.

Various visualizations, like scatter plots and density plots, have been incorporated to represent the differences between red and white wines based on various factors like alcohol content, fixed acidity, and quality.
